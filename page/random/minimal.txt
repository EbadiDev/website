Welcome to the minimalist page.

=======     Why does this page even exist?      =======
For short: to fill up my website.

This page is completely accesible to anyone, any system can handle text.
Sometimes I wanna get a break from all of those <tags/> and CSS and stuff.
I also want more content on this website so I decided to make this.
People using a browser like links can also easily view this page.

This page isn't meant to look pretty, it's just meant to.. do almost nothing, that's the point of this page.
I will try to keep updating this page when I'm out of ideas heh.
